The main task was to develop a simple todo-list app.
The app should allow to:
-add tasks to the list (from input text field)
-remove tasks from the list (by clicking remove button located next to each task)

Entire app is done in js with classes and OOP. There is only one variable in global scope avail. You can pass css selector (if you want) to the main class constructor to render app in chosen location or just render it in the document.body (default). Using render function with every change of app state as default.
